t1:
I want to refactor some old C++ code I wrote, so that I can use it in another context, can you help me? The code is my attempt at implementing a pairing heap by creating a basic priority queue class to derive the pairing heap from. The base class is called "Eecs281PQ" which you will see declared as the base class and friend. Can you suggest any optimizations and/or redundancies we can refactor regarding my pairing heap implementation? Do not implement any suggestions you come up, just create a comprehensive list of them so that I can review what you came up with. For now, I have identified some code duplication regarding the destructor and update priorities functions. Please refactor these functions by abstracting away the duplicate code into a helper function called "traversalHelper" such that I can simply call the helper within the functions I mentioned and the it will seamlessly do the abstracted work. Dont forget to provide comments in all the places you refactor detailing exactly what you did. Here is the code: I supplied <PairingPQ.h> here.









































P1: 

I want to implement my own priority queue containers in cpp20. Generate a abstract base class that defines the interface (eg all the operations and behav that pqs support) of a generic pq called "SPsPQ" that deafualts as a max pq but can alsoaccept a comparison functor, which should be stored in a mem var, for custom compare and complex datatype; make it possible to derive other classes from it ie so that the members can be access from the base and from derived but not outside. only the destructor and the member functions should be available to access from outside. make sure implicit conversions are not possible when constructing an object of this base pq. the base class should have all the member functions and vars needed for a pq and should handle any datatype. in the future we will implement other pqs that will use their own data structures.
